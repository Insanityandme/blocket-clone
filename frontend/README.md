# Frontend (Plocket)

Plocket is a web application that allows users to buy and sell a wide range of products. The design of the application is heavily inspired by blocket.se (itâ€™s similar to Facebook's marketplace but for Swedish users). The application is separated into two parts, a frontend and a backend.

Here is a short demo of the application, it does not however show all features but most of them: https://youtu.be/csRdmTOqPbI

Features:

- Login/Register an account
- Sell a product by creating a listing with information & images of a product you want to sell
- Watch current ads the user has published
- Subscribe to categories and get notified via your inbox when a new item in that category is posted
- Add products to your cart
- Buy products (without payment logic implemented)
- Search for products using categories, price, condition, and name
- See order history
